    "For this lab we have divided the assignments into **three phases/parts**. The `first two phases` refer to the `exercises inside the Master notebooks` of the [DM2025-Lab2-Exercise Repo](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise.git). The `third phase` refers to an `internal Kaggle competition` that we are gonna run among all the Data Mining students. Together they add up to `100 points` of your grade. There are also some `bonus points` to be gained if you complete `extra exercises` in the lab **(bonus 15 pts)** and in the `Kaggle Competition report` **(bonus 5 pts)**.\n",

    "- **Phase 1 exercises:** Need GPU for training the models explained in that part, if you don't have a GPU in your laptop it is recommended to run in Colab or Kaggle for a faster experience, although with CPU they can still be solved but with a slower execution.\n",
    "- **Phase 2 exercises:** We use Gemini's API so everything can be run with only CPU without a problem.\n",
    "- **Phase 3 exercises:** For the competition you will probably need GPU to train your models, so it is recommended to use Colab or Kaggle if you don't have a laptop with a dedicated GPU.\n",
    "- **Optional Ollama Notebook (not graded):** You need GPU, at least 4GB of VRAM with 16 GB of RAM to run the local open-source LLM models. \n",

    "2. Second, I load data from `emotions.json` (which contains the classifications) into a dataframe. From this dataframe, I drop the `id` since it shouldn't be used to train/fit the data. \n",
    "3. Third, I data from `data_identification.csv` into a dataframe. \n",
    "    * I add the corresponding post/text to each entry in my new dataframe by merging in the dataframe from point #1.\n",
    "    * I split this dataframe into test and train set based off of the entry's identification. \n",
    "    * I drop the `split` feature from all dataframes since everything has already been split, so this feature is no longer useful.\n",

    "### 1.2 Feature Engineering Steps\n",
    "I decided to add 3 features. The first feature I added counts exclamation marks which I think would be associated with joy and surprise, since people often use exclamations to emphasize excitement. I achieve this by directly counting the number of exclamation marks in each text. The second feature I added counts question marks which I think would be associated with surprise, as questions can indicate curiosity. I achieve this by directly counting the number of question marks in each text. The third feature I added counts capitalized words, which I think would be associated with disgust and anger. I do this by splitting each text entry into individual words and  checking if each word is uppercase.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 1.3 Explanation of Your Model\n",
    "1. First, I split the train data set further into train and validation with a 80/20 split.\n",
    "    * I use the features `['text', 'exclamation_mark_count', 'question_mark_count', 'capitalized_word_count']` for training.\n",
    "2. Second, I declare a preprocessor. This is necessary because I have numerical and text data.\n",
    "    * The numerical data needs to be standardized with `StandardScaler` so certain features don't dominate.\n",
    "    * I use `TfidfVectorizer` so that the the raw text can be converted into numerical features that the model can understand.\n",
    "3. Third, I create a pipeline that processes the data first using the preprocessor from point #2 and then runs `LogisticRegression` on the output.\n",
    "4. Fourth, I train my model on the training set.\n",
    "5. Fifth, I predict the results of the validation set.\n",
    "6. Sixth, I measure the accuracy of the prediction of the validation set using `accurcy_score()` and `f1_score()`.\n",
