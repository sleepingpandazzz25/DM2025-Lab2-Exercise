      "Of course! Data mining is incredibly important because it transforms raw data—which organizations have in massive quantities—into valuable, actionable intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it this way: many companies are sitting on a mountain of data, but that data is like crude oil. It's valuable, but you can't put it directly into your car. Data mining is the refinery process that turns that crude oil into gasoline, plastic, and other useful products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a breakdown of why data mining is so important, with real-world examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. It Uncovers Hidden Patterns and Insights\n",
      "At its core, data mining is about finding non-obvious patterns, correlations, and trends in large datasets that a human would never be able to spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Example: Market Basket Analysis.** A classic example is a supermarket discovering that customers who buy diapers on a Thursday evening are also very likely to buy beer. This insight allows the store to place beer next to the diapers, leading to a significant increase in sales. This isn't an obvious connection, but data revealed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. It Enables Predictive Analytics and Forecasting\n",
      "Data mining isn't just about understanding the past; it's about using that understanding to predict the future. This allows organizations to be proactive instead of reactive.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Example: Customer Churn.** A telecom company can analyze the behavior of customers who have left in the past (e.g., increased customer service calls, decreased data usage). They can then build a model that monitors current customers for these same behaviors, allowing them to offer a special deal or improved service *before* the customer decides to leave.\n",
      "*   **Example: Demand Forecasting.** Retailers like Amazon and Walmart use data mining to predict demand for products in different regions, ensuring they have the right amount of stock in the right warehouses to minimize shipping times and avoid stockouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. It Drives Business Growth and Profitability\n",
      "By understanding customers better and predicting trends, companies can make smarter decisions that directly impact their bottom line.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Example: Personalized Recommendations.** Services like **Netflix**, **Spotify**, and **Amazon** are masters of this. They mine your viewing/listening/purchasing history to recommend new content or products you're highly likely to enjoy. This keeps you engaged on their platform and encourages you to spend more.\n",
      "*   **Example: Targeted Marketing.** Instead of a \"spray and pray\" approach, companies can segment customers into specific groups based on their behavior and demographics. A company can then create highly targeted marketing campaigns that are more effective and have a much higher return on investment (ROI).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. It Enhances Safety, Security, and Risk Management\n",
      "Data mining is a critical tool for identifying anomalies and deviations from the norm, which is essential for security and risk assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Example: Fraud Detection.** Your credit card company uses data mining to learn your typical spending patterns. If a transaction suddenly appears from a different country just minutes after you used your card locally, the system flags it as potentially fraudulent and may block the transaction or alert you.\n",
      "*   **Example: Insurance & Loan Applications.** Financial institutions mine historical data to assess the risk of a new applicant. By analyzing the profiles of past customers who defaulted on loans or made large claims, they can more accurately price premiums and set interest rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. It Revolutionizes Science and Healthcare\n",
      "Data mining is not just for business. It's accelerating research and improving patient outcomes in profound ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Example: Medical Diagnosis.** Researchers can mine vast amounts of patient data, genetic information, and medical images to identify subtle patterns that correlate with diseases like cancer or Alzheimer's. This can lead to earlier diagnoses and more effective treatment plans.\n",
      "*   **Example: Drug Discovery.** Pharmaceutical companies analyze genetic and biological data to identify potential targets for new drugs, dramatically speeding up the research and development process.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. It Improves Operational Efficiency\n",
      "Organizations can use data mining to streamline their internal processes, saving time and money.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Example: Predictive Maintenance.** A factory can place sensors on its machinery. By mining this sensor data, they can predict when a machine part is likely to fail. This allows them to perform maintenance *before* a costly breakdown occurs, preventing downtime and production losses.\n",
      "*   **Example: Supply Chain Optimization.** Companies can analyze shipping routes, weather patterns, and fuel costs to find the most efficient ways to transport goods, reducing costs and delivery times.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary: The Shift from \"What Happened?\" to \"What Will Happen?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Without data mining, businesses are stuck looking in the rearview mirror, analyzing historical reports to see *what happened*.\n",
      "\n",
      "With data mining, they can look ahead through the windshield. It allows them to move from:\n",
      "*   **Descriptive Analytics (What happened?):** \"We sold 10,000 units last quarter.\"\n",
      "*   **Diagnostic Analytics (Why did it happen?):** \"Sales were high because of our marketing campaign.\"\n",
      "*   **Predictive Analytics (What will happen?):** \"Based on current trends, we predict we will sell 12,000 units next quarter.\"\n",
      "*   **Prescriptive Analytics (What should we do about it?):** \"We should increase inventory by 20% to meet the predicted demand.\"\n",

    "The gemini-2.5-pro model gives examples with every point, while gemini-2.5-flash-lite does not. The pro model uses analogies to explain\n",
    "and has a longer introduction than the lite. The answers provided by pro are a bit more in depth (the examples and multi-step reasoning really show this). The lite model gives a structured overview and mentions a lot of concepts (ex: \"Risk Management\"). The end/summary of the pro is also much longer than the lite. The lite summarizes its findings in a sentence, whereas the pro writes a whole paragraph to summarize it. The tone from the two models are also different: the lite is more curt and concise, while the pro is more conversational. The examples really help make the pro feel more coversational.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 4: Discuss what would happen if you changed the system prompt\n",
    "The system prompt seems to be \"You are a helpful assistant\" defined by the SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION constant. If we were to change the prompt, the output of lite and pro would both change. For example, if we specified that the answer had to be 3 sentences, then both would see to be more concise, since they're forced to be. The output of both of them are numbered bullet points, which makes sense for a helpful assistant to provide. However, if we were to change it to something else like \"You are a helpful journalist\", the output might be in paragraphs and have a more serious tone. We can also ask it to explain more simple or complicated way by adding constrains like \"You are a helpful assistant to a 8 year old\" (in which case, the responses would probably be a lot more simple and had easier vocabulary)."

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

    "As the number of shots increase, the overall accuracy of correct predictions increases. What this means is that for zero-shot, there are multiple misclassifications and this behavior is uneven across classes. Zero-shot is biased towards predictions for joy and anger . In other words, when the true label isn't anger, there are still multiple instances of it being predicted as anger. The same behavior is present for joy. With 1-shot, the predictions become more stable. There's less bias towards predicting anger and joy. The predictions are more evenly distributed throughout all the emotions. There's still some confusion with fear being predicted as anger. With 5-shot, the predictions become even more stable. The diagonal, which represents correct predictions/true positives, is more strong (darker color). There's still confusion around fear, as it it's predicted incorrectly more often than it's predicted correctly. Although there's still confision around fear being predicted as anger. Overall, there's clear improvement from zero-shot to 5-shot.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
